Using your solution to exercise4 (or alternatively my exercise4 reference solution) convert the VLAN dictionary to use sets instead of lists (for the dictionary values). After you have converted these dictionary values to sets perform the following set operations:
Find the interfaces that are common to VLAN1, VLAN2, and VLAN3 (i.e. interfaces that are members of all three VLANs).
Find all of the interfaces that are associated with any VLAN.
Find all of the interfaces that are associated with VLAN12 or VLAN13 (an interface that belongs to either VLAN or to both VLANs).
