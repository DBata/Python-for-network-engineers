Create a Python program that reads in the file named show_ip_int_brief.txt.

Loop over the file contents (in some way) and find the address that belongs to the "10.220" network.

Once you find the line containing the "10.220.x.x" address, extract both the interface name and the IP address. Save these two items to variables named "intf_name" and "ip_addr". Print these variables out to standard output.
