Using the following show_ip_int_brief.txt file (captured from a Cisco IOS-XE router), create a dictionary where the keys are the interface names and the corresponding values are the IP addresses. Skip any lines that do not contain a valid IP address.

Use rich.print to print the resulting data structure to standard output.
