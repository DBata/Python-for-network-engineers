          -create and edit a file with 'vi' -text editor
          -$vi example.py ->> creates the file and enters the editor 
          -while in text editor:
               -command 'i' to enable editing
               -sample text;
                                #!/usr/bin/env python
                                print(f"Enter your name:{input()}")
               -then: esc + :wq ->>quits and saves the input
          $chmod 755 example.py ->>changes the file to executable
          $./example.py  ->>executes the file
